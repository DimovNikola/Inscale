The solution can be done using microservices which will communicate wiht HttpClient and use a message broker like RabbitMQ or Azure Messaging Survice Bus
- Resources microservice
- Bookings microservice
- Mailing micorservice

- Add user accounts (authentication/authorization)
- Admin panel
- Display resources with available dates
- Add paging for resources table
- Update FE when resource booked
- Resource booking on FE can be done as a FORM and have better validation

- Add tracing in order to monitor app performance and diagnose errors (for example OpenTelemetry)
- Can add API documentation

Ideas never stop comming... :D
